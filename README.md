Here is source code for the original revolutionary & ground-breaking chess engine from 2009.

Includes Visual studio project files...

For clarity, the source code (which orignally incorporated one single file)...has been re-organized to include logical header files.

Many (all) bugs have been removed, source code has been formatted, and the project has been configured to compile both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.

for more info...

Compile it yourself using the included project files, or check the 'Release' & 'x64/Release' sub-directories for pre-compiled binaries.

Enjoy this fantastic and historic chess engine!
